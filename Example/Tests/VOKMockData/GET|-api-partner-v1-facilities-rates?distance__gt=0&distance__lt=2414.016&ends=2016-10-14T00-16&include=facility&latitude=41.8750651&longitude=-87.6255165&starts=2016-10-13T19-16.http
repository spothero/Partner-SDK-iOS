Rarely, the valet will park the car in a spot that's not blocked in by other cars so the customer can keep their keys when they start parking rather than picking them up before the valet leaves. Sundays there is no valet, it's all self park. Double parking is an option, however the customer that does this will need to leave their car keys in the vehicle so the person that's blocked in can more the car to get out (these are highlighted on the parking pass so customers are aware before they purchase).
