"text" : "I have used SpotHero multiple times, each with great success which has included needing to find an alternate location. Unlike many customer service issues with technology based app services, you actually reach someone in support so promptly and they are so able to assist, it restores my faith a bit!  \n\nIt is important for me to share some more specifics about a SpotHero interaction that happened on 9/27/16. I returned from vacation to the parking lot at 51st and Pulaski (Chicago) only to find that my car had been removed from the lot.  I immediately called SpotHero and spoke with a representative. Immediately SpotHero went into action by starting to call the tow companies and the 311 service in Chicago. It quickly became apparent that the car had been stolen, not towed.  Taylor (Supervisor) became involved as part of the process. Her kindness, attention to detail, welcoming feedback (I recommended they reconsider a partnership with this location or consider a disclaimer as there is no gate, no security cameras, etc. and the police indicated that this area has a high vehicle theft issue), and going above and beyond to assist me in this quite stressful situation.\n\nI cannot say enough positive things about Taylor and the other individuals that I am working with through this process.  I readily give this company two thumbs up and send a virtual hug and handshake out to Taylor!",

"text" : "I've been using spot hero for about 2 years now.  They saved more over 75 per month on parking for a monthly spot right by Chicago's magnificent mile area. Now the same me about 50% on a daily spot.  When the garages scanner want working, I let spot hero now when they reached out and asked.  They let the garage know to fix it right away.  It's obviously up to the garage to make the repair, but spot hero handled the matter quickly and exactly right. A real person responded to the matter, not just an automated email.\n\nI will keep and recommending them.",

I park downtown all the time, so having this app saves me an incredible amount of money and it makes me feel like a VIP, my spot is reserved before I even get there. The customer service is incredible as well! Keep it up SpotHero!",
