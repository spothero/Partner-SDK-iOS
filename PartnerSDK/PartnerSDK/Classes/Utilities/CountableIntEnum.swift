/**
 A swift protocol to make any Int enum able to count its cases.
 
 Super-useful for making enums to help you deal with sections in tableviews without having to maintain a case for the count of the enum.
 
 Developed by Logan Wright here:
 https://gist.github.com/LoganWright/c8a26b1faf538e40f747
 
 Based on this and the subsequent 3 slides from my talk about
 Laziness-Driven Development at CocoaConf Boston 2015:
